# AWS-Serverless-App
In this project, I deployed a serverless AWS app using the Amplify console that can call a Lambda function via API Gateway.

The overall goals of the project are the following:
- Create a web app
- Connect the web app to a serverless backend
- Add interactivity to your web app with an API and a database
